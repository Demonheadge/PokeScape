## üåã _IMPORTANT CHANGES_ üåã

### [_**The Expansion now uses Modern compilers by default**_](https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3305)

- We have enabled `-Werror -Wall` in the Makefile. These flags show warnings for undefined behaviors in the old compiler (`agbcc`), and sets all warnings as errors. As such, we have updated the codebase so that all warnings that **gcc 13** throws are handled:
  - CI now uses devkitarm container to run a more modern gcc by @SBird1337 in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3429
    - Fix by @AsparagusEduardo in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3530
  - Fixed `-Wall -Werror` errors on Modern by @DizzyEggg in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3412
  - Fixed warnings introduced by gcc 13 by @SBird1337 in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3428
    - `-Warray-bounds`
    - `-Waddress`
    - `-Warray-parameter`
  - Fixed `-Wmaybe-uninitialized` for `ModifyPersonalityForNature` test by @SBird1337 in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3457
- _**Modern compiler may raise the following errors for code introduced from outside the expansion, so we recommend solving those errors:**_
  - `unused-function`. To solve it, add `UNUSED` to the function definition.
    ```diff
    -static void Function(void)
    +static void UNUSED Function(void)
    ```
  - `unused-variable`. To solve it, remove the unused variable.
    ```diff
    static void Function(void)
    {
    -   u8 unused;
        u8 used;
    ...
    ```
  - `unused-but-set-variable`. To solve it, add `UNUSED` to the variable definition.
    ```diff
    static void Function(void)
    {
    -   u8 unused;
    +   u8 UNUSED unused;
        u8 used;
        unused = DoSomething();
    ...
    ```
- Updated modern compiler install instructions by @hedara90 in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3527
- _**You may still use `agbcc` by adding**_ `agbcc` to your `make` command to finish the update process before fixing these errors.
  - eg. `make -j8 agbcc`.
  - We may drop support for it in the future, so we recommend updating the code to support the new compilers.
  - This will generate `pokeemerald_agbcc.gba`, while modern will generate `pokeemerald.gba` by @Bassoonian in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3462

  - Also sets `B_OBEDIENCE_MECHANICS`'s default config to `GEN_LATEST`, where obedience restrictions also apply to non-outsider Pok√©mon, albeit based on their level met rather than actual level.
  - Thanks to combination of the added obedience levels matching ORAS' with vanilla Emerald's encounter levels, there's not a single instance were players need to worry about caught Pok√©mon not obeying as soon as they are caught.
- Decoupled Affection values from Friendship rater thresholds, making them occur less often than what they used to by @kittenchilly in https://github.com/rh-hideout/pokeemerald-expansion/pull/3495
